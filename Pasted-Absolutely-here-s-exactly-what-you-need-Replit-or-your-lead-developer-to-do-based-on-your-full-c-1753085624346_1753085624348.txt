Absolutely — here’s exactly what you need Replit (or your lead developer) to do based on your full chat history, screenshots, and objectives. This is a comprehensive technical + strategic task list, broken into critical phases to deliver a clean, production-grade “LinkedIn for Sports” platform.

⸻

✅ GOAL:

You want a fully working platform that allows:
	•	Seamless sign-up/sign-in (Google, email, phone, demo)
	•	Athlete, brand, and employer onboarding
	•	A polished and fully functioning job application form (as detailed in your screenshots)
	•	Secure Firestore rules and data persistence
	•	High-quality, scalable frontend with no blockers or bugs

⸻

🔧 REPLIT TASK LIST — DO THIS NOW:

1. 🔥 CRITICAL FIXES (must be working first)

🔐 AUTH FLOW FIXES
	•	Remove anonymous auto sign-in (breaks account upgrades & demo flow)
	•	Fix Google/Apple sign-in race condition: wait for Firestore doc creation instead of assuming “unauthenticated”
	•	Handle auth/account-exists-with-different-credential error → offer to merge accounts
	•	Ensure all social providers (Google, Apple, Facebook) are fully configured in Firebase
	•	Enable signInWithRedirect() on iOS Safari fallback

👤 ACCOUNT CREATION ISSUES
	•	Ensure user profile & onboarding doc is always created after auth
	•	Patch Demo login logic: if demo already exists, reuse it; don’t create duplicates

⸻

2. 💾 FIRESTORE & BACKEND SETUP

🔐 FIRESTORE RULES
	•	Implement strict role-based Firestore rules:
	•	Only allow athletes to update /profiles
	•	Brands/employers can write /jobs and view /applications
	•	Public read access to /jobs, /profiles (with App Check required)

📄 DATABASE STRUCTURE (CONFIRM OR SETUP)
	•	/artifacts/{appId}/users/{uid}
	•	/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/profiles/{uid}
	•	/artifacts/{appId}/public/data/jobs/{jobId}
	•	/artifacts/{appId}/applications/{jobId}/{uid} (new submissions)

⸻

3. 🧠 JOB APPLICATION FORM: FULL FEATURE INTEGRATION

Your multi-step form is beautiful and highly detailed (from screenshots). Make sure this is fully implemented and connected.

	•	All fields from screenshots must be functional (personal info, experience, gov-sector knowledge, creative Qs)
	•	File upload: resumes & cover letters → store in Firebase Storage
	•	Add validation (zod or yup) and UX feedback
	•	On submit: write full payload to /applications/{jobId}/{uid}
	•	Add error boundaries + confirmation screen

⸻

4. 🛠 UI/UX POLISH & FUNCTIONALITY
	•	Turn loading flashes into skeleton screens
	•	Convert critical pages to TypeScript
	•	Break giant components into modular hooks (useAuth, useJobs, useProfile)
	•	Make “My Profile” and “Dashboard” context-aware (don’t show brand dashboard to athlete)
	•	Seed dummy data if collections are empty (jobs, NILs, athlete profiles)

⸻

5. 🚀 PRODUCTION READINESS (optional, for launch)
	•	Firebase Hosting → Cloudflare or Vercel (for custom domain + SEO)
	•	App Check → Enforce mode
	•	GitHub Actions → Lint + Test + Deploy preview channels
	•	Turn off setLogLevel('debug')
	•	Bundle Firebase keys with .env (not hardcoded)

⸻

6. 🔜 NEXT PHASE: PREMIUM FEATURES (plan only)

Once the MVP is solid, move to:

	•	Messaging (Firestore subcollections)
	•	Endorsements / references
	•	Stripe integration for NIL monetization
	•	Verified badge workflow
	•	Algolia or Firestore-powered search

⸻

🧩 FINAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR DEVELOPER / REPLIT TEAM

🗣️ Tell them this directly:

✅ Your job is to deliver a clean, live product with no auth errors and a fully working job application pipeline.
Everything must be connected to Firebase (auth, Firestore, storage) and meet the design shown in screenshots.
No broken links, no temp placeholders, no dummy-only flow — this is an MVP users should be able to use end-to-end.

⸻

Would you like me to draft the Firebase rules or a checklist template for Replit to track this?
