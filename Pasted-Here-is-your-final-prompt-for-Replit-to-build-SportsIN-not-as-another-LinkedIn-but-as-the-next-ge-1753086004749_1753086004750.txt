🚨 MISSION BRIEF
We are building SportsIN, a platform 10000x beyond LinkedIn — a next-gen career + opportunity engine for Indian athletes, brands, and organizations. Our product must integrate the energy and vision of the two attached images (IMG_0278.jpeg & IMG_0279.jpeg) — ambition, empowerment, grit — and reflect that in every component of the experience.

🚧 Immediate Replit Build Goals (Initial Version ++)

	•	Fix ALL sign-in flows (Google, phone, demo, email — no breakage).
	•	Add onboarding wizard that tailors experience by role (athlete, brand, coach, scout, admin).
	•	Role-based dashboard routing.

2. Fully Integrated Dynamic Job Application System
	•	Make the full-length job form functional (see previous screenshots and JPEGs).
	•	Auto-save form progress to Firestore.
	•	Upload resume/cover letter to Firebase Storage.

4. Visual Polish + UI Quality

	•	Responsive layout — working flawlessly on mobile.
	•	Add dark mode toggle and ensure persistence via Firebase user settings.

🌟 Vibe of the Product

Every interaction should feel like a win: animated confetti after job applications, athlete stats shown like player cards, motivational copy (“You’re one step closer to your dream!”). The UI/UX must bleed confidence and clarity — just like IMG_0278 and IMG_0279.
